<!-- ======================================================================
This is a sample file, mainly the file I test the baseline system with;
if your are starting with this as a baseline for your own set of actual
encounters, be advised that you need to change the interval and cleanup
numbers to something bigger. The time is in seconds; I would recommend
something like 500 or more for each. If you use numbers that are too small,
your players will be "swamped with encounters". The result depends on both
probability and timing together, and needs to be tuned by you; this will
requires some planning on your behalf. GOOD LUCK.

"RandomEncounters" tag. This supports the following attributes and defaults:

    * picker = the picking method, defaults to "sqrt". You may want "all" instead.
    * language = the globalization code, defaults to "en-US".
    * skiphidden = tells the system to exclude hidden players from encounters, defaults to true
    * delay = amount of secs before encounters begin after server start, defaults to "60"
    * interval = frequency in secs encounters are checked, defaults to "1800". This field can be separated into as many as 3 values, one each for dungeons, wilderness, and guarded regions. Separate with ":"
    * cleanup = how long to wait before shutting down spawned mobiles, defaults to "300"
    * cleanupGrace = how many times the system will fail to cleanup items if players are in range of them;
                    "0" means never cleanup if player in range
    * debug ="false" (print out extra debugging information)
    * debugEffect ="false" (display an energy vortex on all spawns)
    * RFTM defaults to true. Setting RTFM="true" (or deleting the tag) indicates that you've
           at least made it this far and read some of the instructions.

"Facet" tag.

    * name = (mandatory tag naming the facet)

"Region" tag.

    * type = (mandatory tag specifying region type; can be "Guarded", "Dungeon", and "Wilderness")
    * name =(mandatory tag naming the region; use "default" to pick up generic)

"Encounter" tag.

    * p = probability of encounter, default of "1.0", which means 100%. If p is set to * (e.g., p="*"), the encounter will always be had in addition to any other encounter the player might have for the region
    * distance = the preferred distance from the player for the encounter, a number or a range (example "1" or "0:2" or "1:3"). Default is "7".
    * water (DEPRECATED) = water mobiles can't spawn without this; land mobiles can't spawn with it, default is "false" (DEPRECATED... use landType="Water" instead please)
    * landType= Water, OnRoad, OffRoad, or AnyLand. Default is "AnyLand".
    * time=Night, Twilight, Day, or AnyTime. Default is "AnyTime".
    * level=notional level of the character required to have the encounter; defaults to 1. An optional second argument can be sent to the level indicating class after a separating colon. E.g., "8:Necromancer". Valid current class names are Fighter, Ranger, Mage, Necromancer, Thief, and Overall.
    * scaleUp=true/false, whether or not to scale up encounters that are waker than the player; defaults to false. Never more than triples an encounter.

"Mobile" tag.

    * p = probability of the mobile being included in a picked encounter, default is "1.0"
    * pick = (a comma-separated list of mobiles to pick from (NO SPACES!); one is picked randomly)
    * n = a number or a range (example "1" or "0:2" or "1:3"), default is "1"
    * effect=Smoke, Fire, Vortex, Swirld, Glow. (default is None). Option :tag in the string indicates HUE.
    * forceAttack = true|false (default false) Causes the tagged mob to attack the player upon spawn
